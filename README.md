# PyEncryptX
Python based Gui tool to encrypt files with a passcode (cross-platform)

# Usage
  Use this cross-platform tool to encrypt / decrypt files using a SHA256 AES
  encryption algorithm based on a given password
  
# EncryptX Future
  Hope to add the following features in the future:
  
    -Key Generator Including:
      -RSA key pair generator
      -SHA265 key generator
      -AES key generator
      -Save generated keys to .key files
      
    -SSH Client
      -Use python subprocess to ssh into target host with ip box, user box & passw box
      
    -String Data Encryptor / Decryptor
      -Type any encrypted or unencrypted string into input field
      -Uses .key file or passw to encrypt string
      -Return encrypted or decrypted string in output field
      
    -Byte Data Encryptor / Decryptor
      -Insert any encrypted or unencrypted bytes into input field
      -Uses .key file or passw to encrypt bytes
      -Return encrypted or decrypted bytes in output field
